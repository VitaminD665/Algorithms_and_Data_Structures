For time & space complexity and Big-O notation, always consider the worst case scenario.

Binary Search: O(log(n))
Linear Search: O(n)
Quadratic Runtime: O(n^2)
Cubic Runtime: O(n^3)
Quasilinear: O(nlog(n))
Exponential: O(x^n)

Contained various analogies for explaining algorithm runtimes and whatnot.
