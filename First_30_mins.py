Following the Algorithms and Data Structures course from FreeCodeCamp/Treehouse

Breaks down algorithms as a set of instructions. Focus on optimizations, different
approaches and logical problem-solving and result driven verification.
Defined problem statement, input, and output.

Mathematical correctness, and a formalized mathematical model for algortihms, will
not be a focus in the course.

An algorithm's efficiency.

Evaluating the efficiency of linear search. Time & space complexity.

Now introducing big-O notation.

Linear Search vs. a binary search.

More on binary search in the next 30 mins.

No functional code yet...


For time & space complexity and Big-O notation, always consider the worst case scenario.

Binary Search: O(log(n))
Linear Search: O(n)
Quadratic Runtime: O(n^2)
Cubic Runtime: O(n^3)
Quasilinear: O(nlog(n))
Exponential: O(x^n)

Contained various analogies for explaining algorithm runtimes and whatnot.

*Now creating modules for Linear and Binary Search Algorithms
