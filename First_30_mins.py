Following the Algorithms and Data Structures course from FreeCodeCamp/Treehouse
Link to YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

Breaks down algorithms as a set of instructions. Focus on optimizations, different
approaches and logical problem-solving and result driven verification.
Defined problem statement, input, and output.

Mathematical correctness, and a formalized mathematical model for algortihms, will
not be a focus in the course.

An algorithm's efficiency.

Evaluating the efficiency of linear search. Time & space complexity.

Now introducing big-O notation.

Linear Search vs. a binary search.

More on binary search in the next 30 mins.

No functional code yet...
